## Features and Capabilities

### 1. Pip Installable
The Unity-based traffic simulation is now registered with PyPi, making it easily installable via pip:

```bash
pip install replicantdrivesim
```

This command simplifies the setup process by downloading and installing the package along with its dependencies. Once installed, you can quickly integrate it into your projects by importing the library in your Python scripts.

```python
import replicantdrivesim
```

For more detailed usage instructions, please refer to the documentation in the repository.


### 2. Automated Release Pipeline
The project is equipped with a robust continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) pipeline that:

- Publishes releases to:
  - DockerHub
  - GitHub Container Registry
  - PyPi
- Generates comprehensive documentation on:
  - Read the Docs
  - GitHub Pages
  - Doxygen for C++ code
- Automatically rebuilds and updates the Unity simulation and Python package when updates are made to:
  - C++ code
  - Unity environment
  - Python interface

### 3. Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning with Ray RLlib
- The library supports **Ray's RLlib**, enabling multi-agent training for autonomous driving scenarios.
- With a simple import, you can hand over the environment to Ray for scalable and efficient agent training.
- This feature is designed for large-scale experiments, leveraging Ray's distributed architecture.

### 4. Comprehensive Documentation
Doxygen-generated documentation is available for the C++ code, and additional project documentation is published on Read the Docs and GitHub Pages, ensuring developers have clear and detailed guidance for integration and usage.

- **Doxygen**-generated documentation is available for the C++ code.
- Additional project documentation is published on:
  - Read the Docs
  - GitHub Pages
- This ensures developers have clear and detailed guidance for integration and usage.

### 5. Versioning and Release Management
The pipeline handles release notes generation and tags releases automatically, providing a fully managed versioning system for developers to track changes and improvements.
