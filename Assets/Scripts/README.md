## Unity Life Cycle & Unity ML-Agents Execution Order

This section provides a comprehensive overview of the sequence in which Unity's event functions and ML-Agents methods are executed during gameplay. Understanding this execution order is crucial for developers, as it influences how scripts interact with one another and how agents behave within their environments.

By following the specified order, developers can ensure that their game logic operates smoothly and predictably, avoiding potential issues that arise from relying on unguaranteed execution sequences. This section outlines each method's role in the lifecycle of Unity objects and ML-Agents, helping developers to effectively manage their scripts and optimize agent behaviors for training and simulation.

1. `Awake()`: Called for all objects in the scene.
2. `OnEnable()`: Called for all enabled objects.
3. `Agent.Initialize()`: Called when the ML-Agent is first initialized.
4. `Start()`: Called on the frame when a script is enabled.
5. `Reset()`: Called when the script is reset in the Inspector (Unity method, not specific to ML-Agents).
6. `Agent.OnEpisodeBegin()`: Called at the beginning of each episode, including the start of the simulation.
7. `FixedUpdate()`: Called at fixed time intervals, independent of frame rate.
8. `OnTriggerEnter()`: Called when a trigger collider enters another collider.
9. `OnTriggerStay()`: Called every fixed frame for a trigger collider that stays in another collider.
10. `OnTriggerExit()`: Called when a trigger collider exits another collider.
11. `OnCollisionEnter()`: Called when this collider/rigidbody begins touching another rigidbody/collider.
12. `OnCollisionStay()`: Called every fixed frame for colliders/rigidbodies that stay in contact.
13. `OnCollisionExit()`: Called when this collider/rigidbody stops touching another rigidbody/collider.
14. `Update()`: Called once per frame. Reward-related methods like AddReward() and SetReward() can be called at various points in the execution, typically within Update() or OnActionReceived().
15. `Agent.RequestDecision()`: Called to request a decision from the Agent's policy (can be automatic with DecisionRequester).
16. `Agent.CollectObservations()`: ML-Agents method to collect observations from the environment.
17. `Agent.Heuristic()`: Only called if the Agent's Behavior Type is set to "Heuristic Only".
18. `Agent.OnActionReceived()`: Called with the actions generated by the Heuristic() method.
19. `Agent.OnActionReceived()`: Called only once, after either the normal decision process or Heuristic() method, passing the chosen actions to the Agent.
20. `LateUpdate()`: Called once per frame, after all Update functions have been called.
21. `OnDisable()`: Called when the behavior becomes disabled or inactive.
22. `OnDestroy()`: Called when the script is being destroyed.
23. `Agent.EndEpisode()`: Called to manually end an episode (can happen at any point during execution).
24. `OnApplicationQuit()`: Called on all game objects before the application quits.

Notes:
- Physics-based methods (`OnTrigger` and `OnCollision`) are called during the physics simulation step.
- `Update()` is not inherently called before or after the ML-Agents methods.
- `Agent.EndEpisode()` can be called at any point during execution to manually end an episode.
