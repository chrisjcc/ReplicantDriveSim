# Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) with Ray RLlib

This repository demonstrates how to train multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) models using [Ray RLlib](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/rllib.html). The `trainer_tune.py` script allows you to configure, train, and evaluate MARL agents within a customizable environment.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running the training script, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.7+
- Ray 2.0.0+ with RLlib
- NumPy
- Gym (or custom environment)
- Any other dependencies listed in `requirements.txt` (if provided)

Install the required dependencies using pip:

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
The main training script is trainer_tune.py. This script leverages Ray's RLlib to set up and train multiple agents within a specified environment.

To run the training process, execute:
```shell
python trainer_tune.py
```

## Configuration
The trainer_tune.py script includes several configuration options to customize the training process:

- Environment: You can specify the environment for MARL training, which could be a custom or predefined Gym environment.
- Algorithm: Choose from various RL algorithms supported by RLlib such as PPO, DQN, A3C, etc.
- Hyperparameters: Adjust learning rates, batch sizes, and other hyperparameters for each agent.
- Multi-Agent Setup: Define the policies and mapping from agents to policies in the multi-agent environment.

## Script Overview
- trainer_tune.py: The main script for configuring and running the multi-agent training using Ray RLlib. It includes setting up the environment, configuring the RLlib trainer, and executing the training loop.


## Results and Evaluation
After training, the results and checkpoints will be saved to the directory specified in the script. You can use these checkpoints to evaluate the performance of the trained agents or to resume training.
